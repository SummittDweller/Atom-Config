This is the Atom (~/.atom) configuration from my personal MacBook Air.  
It was initialized on the morning of 16-August-2018 as https://github.com/SummittDweller/Atom-Config.git.  
Clone this repo to other OSX hosts and keep it up-to-date by pusing back any/all configuration chagnes.
Git user 'McFateM' has been added as a collaborator to this repo.

Suggested first use...  

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/SummittDweller/Atom-Config.git ~/.atom
  ```

To update after just...  

```
  git pull origin master
    ...make changes...  
  git add *
  git commit -m "Message"
  git push origin master  

```

To add the 'Modified' date/timestamp to any file just copy the top line of this README.md file and paste it near the top of your intended file.  From that point on Atom _should_ change the timestamp each time the file is saved.
