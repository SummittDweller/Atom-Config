This is the Atom (~/.atom) configuration from my personal MacBook Air.  
It was initialized on the morning of 16-August-2018 as https://github.com/SummittDweller/Atom-Config.git.  
Clone this repo to other OSX hosts and keep it up-to-date by pusing back any/all configuration chagnes.
Git user 'McFateM' has been added as a collaborator to this repo.

Suggest first use...
  git clone https://github.com/SummittDweller/Atom-Config.git ~/.atom

To update after just...
  git pull origin master
  ...make changes...
  git push origin master
